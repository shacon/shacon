## Hi there, I'm Shannon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who recently completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), with experience working across various industries as a full stack developer.

My technical experience includes front-end and back-end development, most recently in Ruby on Rails and Vue.js. I enjoy working on supportive and collaborative teams.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy quilting, taking my border collie for walks by the Chicago lakefront and always naming a third thing when I make a list.
